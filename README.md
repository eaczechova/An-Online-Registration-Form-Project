# An Online Registration Form Project

In this project, I have built a responsive registration form using a variety of HTML form input types and attributes.

The form I have built is using media queries and is based on the supplied mockup files (both for a mobile and desktop version), utilizing a "mobile-first" approach.

Here you can find [link](https://eaczechova.github.io/An-Online-Registration-Form-Project/) to the form.
